This project was aimed at coding B+ trees for implementing numerical insertion and calculating the insertion time graph of the same. 

Language used - C.

1. The B+ folder contains the .pdf report and the associated c code.

2. The B+ GRAPHS folder contains different linear graphs for different values of random element insertion.

3. bst.ps contains the dotty output of the c code. 

4. EXTRA B+ .C CODE folder contains two B+ .c codes. One which is user-interactive and the other modififed for dotty output. 


PS: As there is error in the dotty code, we could not generate a DOTTY TREE for more than 25 elements.
